### Login
`ssh`: ssh leviathan1@leviathan.labs.overthewire.org -p 2223
`password`: PPIfmI1qsA

### Solution
Lets use the `ls -al` command to see what files are availabe for us in the home directory:

```shell
leviathan1@gibson:~$ ls -al
total 36
drwxr-xr-x  2 root       root        4096 Oct  5 06:19 .
drwxr-xr-x 83 root       root        4096 Oct  5 06:20 ..
-rw-r--r--  1 root       root         220 Jan  6  2022 .bash_logout
-rw-r--r--  1 root       root        3771 Jan  6  2022 .bashrc
-r-sr-x---  1 leviathan2 leviathan1 15072 Oct  5 06:19 check
-rw-r--r--  1 root       root         807 Jan  6  2022 .profile
```

It seems that there's a binary named `check` available. It also looks like this binary can be executed. Let's execute `check` to understand its functionality:

```shell
leviathan1@gibson:~$ ./check 
password: apple
Wrong password, Good Bye ...
```

It appears we must enter the right password. But where could this password be located? Let's use `ltrace` while running the binary to see if we can uncover any helpful details:

```shell
leviathan1@gibson:~$ ltrace ./check 
__libc_start_main(0x80491e6, 1, 0xffffd5f4, 0 <unfinished ...>
printf("password: ")                                                           = 10
getchar(0xf7fbe4a0, 0xf7fd6f90, 0x786573, 0x646f67password: apple
)                            = 97
getchar(0xf7fbe4a0, 0xf7fd6f61, 0x786573, 0x646f67)                            = 112
getchar(0xf7fbe4a0, 0xf7fd7061, 0x786573, 0x646f67)                            = 112
strcmp("app", "sex")                                                           = -1
puts("Wrong password, Good Bye ..."Wrong password, Good Bye ...
)                                           = 29
+++ exited (status 0) +++
```

Take note of the `strcmp` function. It's comparing the initial three characters of our input with `sex`. This suggests that the password we need to input is `sex`:

```shell
leviathan1@gibson:~$ ./check 
password: sex
$ 
```

Looks like we were given a shell? What happens if we try and cat the password file for leviathan2?

```shell
$ cat /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan2
mEh5PNl10e
```
