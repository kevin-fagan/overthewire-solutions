# Level 6

### Login
`ssh`: ssh leviathan6@leviathan.labs.overthewire.org -p 2223
`password`: YZ55XPVk2l

### Solution
Lets use the `ls -al` command to see what files are availabe for us in the home directory:
```shell
leviathan6@gibson:~$ ls -al
total 36
drwxr-xr-x  2 root       root        4096 Oct  5 06:19 .
drwxr-xr-x 83 root       root        4096 Oct  5 06:20 ..
-rw-r--r--  1 root       root         220 Jan  6  2022 .bash_logout
-rw-r--r--  1 root       root        3771 Jan  6  2022 .bashrc
-r-sr-x---  1 leviathan7 leviathan6 15024 Oct  5 06:19 leviathan6
-rw-r--r--  1 root       root         807 Jan  6  2022 .profile
```

It seems that there's a binary named `leviathan6` available. It also looks like this binary can be executed. Let's execute `leviathan6` to understand its functionality:

```shell
leviathan6@gibson:~$ ./leviathan6 
usage: ./leviathan6 <4 digit code>
```

It seems that the binary needs a 4-digit code. You could attempt to use the `strings`, `ltrace`, or `strace` commands, but I couldn't extract any valuable information using these commands. As a result, I chose to take a brute force approach:

```shell
leviathan6@gibson:~$ for i in {0000..9999}; do ./leviathan6 $i; done
```

Give it a few seconds and you will eventually get a shell as `leviathan7`:
