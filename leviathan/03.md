# Level 3

### Login
`ssh`: ssh leviathan3@leviathan.labs.overthewire.org -p 2223
`password`: Q0G8j4sakn

### Solution
Lets use the `ls -al` command to see what files are availabe for us in the home directory:

```shell
leviathan3@gibson:~$ ls -al
total 40
drwxr-xr-x  2 root       root        4096 Oct  5 06:19 .
drwxr-xr-x 83 root       root        4096 Oct  5 06:20 ..
-rw-r--r--  1 root       root         220 Jan  6  2022 .bash_logout
-rw-r--r--  1 root       root        3771 Jan  6  2022 .bashrc
-r-sr-x---  1 leviathan4 leviathan3 18072 Oct  5 06:19 level3
-rw-r--r--  1 root       root         807 Jan  6  2022 .profile
```

It seems that there's a binary named `level3` available. It also looks like this binary can be executed. Let's execute `level3` to understand its functionality:

```shell
leviathan3@gibson:~$ ./level3
Enter the password> apple
bzzzzzzzzap. WRONG
```

It appears we must enter the right password. But where could this password be located? Let's use `ltrace` while running the binary to see if we can uncover any helpful details:

```shell
leviathan3@gibson:~$ ltrace ./level3 
__libc_start_main(0x80492bf, 1, 0xffffd5f4, 0 <unfinished ...>
strcmp("h0no33", "kakaka")                                                      = -1
printf("Enter the password> ")                                                  = 20
fgets(Enter the password> apple
"apple\n", 256, 0xf7e2a620)                                               = 0xffffd3cc
strcmp("apple\n", "snlprintf\n")                                                = -1
puts("bzzzzzzzzap. WRONG"bzzzzzzzzap. WRONG
)                                                      = 19
+++ exited (status 0) +++
```

Similar to level `01`, we should pay attention to the `strcmp` function. It's comparing our input with `snlprintf`. Let's execute the binary once more, but this time, we'll use `snlprintf` as our input:

```shell
leviathan3@gibson:~$ ./level3 
Enter the password> snlprintf
[You've got shell]!
$ 
```

It seems that we've gained access to a shell. By using `whoami`, we can confirm that we are `leviathan4`. From this point, we can utilize `cat` to retrieve the password from the `leviathan4` file:

```
$ whoami             
leviathan4
$ cat /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan4
AgvropI4OA
```
