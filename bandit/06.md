# Level 6

### Goal
The password for the next level is stored in a file somewhere under the inhere directory and has all of the following properties:
- human-readable
- 1033 bytes in size
- not executable

### Login
`ssh`: ssh bandit5@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
`password`: lrIWWI6bB37kxfiCQZqUdOIYfr6eEeqR

### Solution
We can use the `find` command to find the file we are looking for. We want to find a file that is not exectuable and is 1033 bits in size. We can do so like such:
```shell
bandit5@bandit:~$ find ./inhere/ -not -executable -size 1033c
./inhere/maybehere07/.file2
```

We can see that `./inhere/maybehere07/.file2` was returned to us. Lets `cat` the file to see if it contains the password for the next level:
```shell
bandit5@bandit:~$ cat ./inhere/maybehere07/.file2
