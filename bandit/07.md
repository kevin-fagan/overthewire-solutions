# Level 7

### Goal
The password for the next level is stored somewhere on the server and has all of the following properties:
- owned by user bandit7
- owned by group bandit6
- 33 bytes in size

### Login
`ssh`: ssh bandit6@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
`password`: P4L4vucdmLnm8I7Vl7jG1ApGSfjYKqJU

### Solution
We can use the `find` command to find the file we are looking for. Because the file we are looking for is somewhere on the server, ensure you start your search from the root (/) directory:
```shell
bandit6@bandit:/$ find . -user bandit7 -size 33c -group bandit6
find: ‘./etc/ssl/private’: Permission denied
find: ‘./etc/polkit-1/localauthority’: Permission denied
find: ‘./etc/sudoers.d’: Permission denied
.
.
./var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password
.
.
```

We can see that `./var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password` was returned to us. Lets `cat` the file to see if it contains the password for the next level:
```shell
bandit6@bandit:/$ cat ./var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password
