# Level 1

### Goal
The password for the next level is stored in a file called readme located in the home directory. Use this password to log into bandit1 using SSH. Whenever you find a password for a level, use SSH (on port 2220) to log into that level and continue the game.

### Login
`ssh`: ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
`password`: bandit0

### Solution
We can use the `cat` command to print the contents of `readme` to `stdout`:
```shell
bandit0@bandit:~$ cat readme
