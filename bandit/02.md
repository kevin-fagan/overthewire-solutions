# Level 2

### Goal
The password for the next level is stored in a file called - located in the home directory

### Login
`ssh`: ssh bandit1@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
`password`: NH2SXQwcBdpmTEzi3bvBHMM9H66vVXjL

### Solution
Using "-" as a filename is entirely valid. However, it can cause confusion as command options typically begin with a dash. Therefore, if you try to use `cat -`, the output may not be as anticipated. This issue can be resolved by specifying the file's path like such:
```shell
bandit1@bandit:~$ cat ./-
rRGizSaX8Mk1RTb1CNQoXTcYZWU6lgzi
