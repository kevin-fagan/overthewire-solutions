# Level 4

### Goal
The password for the next level is stored in a hidden file in the inhere directory.

### Login
`ssh`: ssh bandit3@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
`password`: aBZ0W5EmUfAf7kHTQeOwd8bauFJ2lAiG

### Solution
The password for the next level is stored within `~/inhere/.hidden`. Hidden files always begin with a `.` and may not appear when using commands such as `ls`. However, you can use `ls -a` to show ALL files, including ones that are hidden.
```shell
bandit3@bandit:~$ cd inhere/
bandit3@bandit:~/inhere$ ls -a
.  ..  .hidden
bandit3@bandit:~/inhere$ cat .hidden
