# Level 20

### Goal
To gain access to the next level, you should use the setuid binary in the homedirectory. Execute it without arguments to find out how to use it. The password for this level can be found in the usual place (/etc/bandit_pass), after you have used the setuid binary.

### Login
`ssh`: ssh bandit19@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
`password`: awhqfNnAbc1naukrpqDYcF95h7HoMTrC

### Solution
We can use the setuid binary in the homedirectory to run a command with the permissions of `bandit20`:
```shell
bandit19@bandit:~$ ./bandit20-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit20
