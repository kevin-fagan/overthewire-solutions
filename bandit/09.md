# Level 9

### Goal
The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt and is the only line of text that occurs only once

### Login
`ssh`: ssh bandit8@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
`password`: TESKZC0XvTetK0S9xNwm25STk5iWrBvP

### Solution
The `uniq` command does not detect repeated lines unless they are adjacent. Therefore, before utilizing the `uniq` command, we need to first sort the file using the `sort` command. After sorting, we can pipe the output to `uniq`:
```shell
bandit8@bandit:~$ sort data.txt | uniq -u
