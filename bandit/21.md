# Level 21

### Goal
There is a setuid binary in the homedirectory that does the following: it makes a connection to localhost on the port you specify as a commandline argument. It then reads a line of text from the connection and compares it to the password in the previous level (bandit20). If the password is correct, it will transmit the password for the next level (bandit21).

NOTE: Try connecting to your own network daemon to see if it works as you think

### Login
`ssh`: ssh bandit20@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
`password`: VxCazJaVykI6W36BkBU0mJTCM8rR95XT

### Solutions
I recommend using the `tmux` command to create multiple terminal sessions. From session 1, we can use the `nc` command to listen for incoming connections. When a connection is made, we can enter the password of `bandit20` to retrieve the password for the next level:
```shell
bandit20@bandit:~$ nc -l -p 1234
VxCazJaVykI6W36BkBU0mJTCM8rR95XT
NvEJF7oVjkddltPSrdKEFOllh9V1IBcq
bandit20@bandit:~$ 
```

For session 2, we can use the `suconnect` binary to make a connection that was opened with `nc`: 
```shell
bandit20@bandit:~$ ./suconnect 1234

Password matches, sending next password
