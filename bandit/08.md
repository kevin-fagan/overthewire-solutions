# Level 8

### Goal
The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt next to the word millionth

### Login
`ssh`: ssh bandit7@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
`password`: z7WtoNQU2XfjmMtWA8u5rN4vzqu4v99S

### Solution
We can use the `grep` command to find the line that contains the password we are looking for:
```shell
bandit7@bandit:~$ grep "millionth" data.txt 
millionth	TESKZC0XvTetK0S9xNwm25STk5iWrBvP
