# Level 3

### Goal
The password for the next level is stored in a file called spaces in this filename located in the home directory

### Login
`ssh`: ssh bandit2@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
`password`: rRGizSaX8Mk1RTb1CNQoXTcYZWU6lgzi

### Solution
Having spaces in a filename is entirely acceptable. To correctly use the cat command on such a file, there are two methods. You can encase the filename in quotes, or you can use escape characters for the spaces:
```shell
bandit2@bandit:~$ cat spaces\ in\ this\ filename 
aBZ0W5EmUfAf7kHTQeOwd8bauFJ2lAiG
```
```shell
bandit2@bandit:~$ cat "spaces in this filename" 
aBZ0W5EmUfAf7kHTQeOwd8bauFJ2lAiG
```
