# Level 15

### Goal
The password for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to port 30000 on localhost.

### Login
`ssh`: ssh bandit14@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
`password`: fGrHPx402xGC7U7rXKDaxiWFTOiF0ENq

### Solution
We can obtain the password by using the `telnet` command:
```shell
bandit14@bandit:~$ telnet localhost 30000
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.
